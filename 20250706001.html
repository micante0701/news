                    Japan is to implement a new agricultural policy for rice from 2027 as a rice shortage leads to a
                    historic price spike and exposes the limitations of the old policy

                    By Kaori Kaneko / Reuters, JOETSU, Japan
                </p>
                <!-- 正文開始 -->
                <p>For more than half a century, the Japanese government has encouraged its rice farmers to grow less of
                    the crop so that prices of the national staple grain remained relatively high and steady.</p>
                <p>Now, under an ambitious agricultural policy announced this year, Tokyo is preparing for a reversal,
                    envisaging a future of bountiful output that would secure the country's food security without
                    sending prices into freefall and hurting its politically influential farmers.</p>
                <p>The new direction has taken on an unexpected urgency as Japanese grapple with a shortage of the
                    all-important staple, which has prompted a historic spike in prices, a flood of imports and interest
                    from US President Donald Trump, who has renewed pressure on Japan to buy US rice as part of the
                    allies' elusive trade deal.</p>

                </div>
                <p>It is a policy that many farmers like Kazuhachi Hosaka welcome in principle, but with trepidation
                    because questions over how it would work in practice remain unanswered. The government is aiming to
                    complete a roadmap by the middle of next year.</p>
                <p>“We'd want the government to make sure there's some kind of a safety net for producers,” Hosaka said
                    at his farm in the northern prefecture of Niigata. “It's easy enough to switch rice for feed or
                    processed foods to staple rice, but tilling land for new paddies or switching from wheat or soybeans
                    would require labor, machinery and all kinds of investments.”</p>
                <p>This year, Hosaka allocated all but 10 hectares of his 180-hectare land for staple rice, reducing
                    feed-use rice by 20 hectares given the attractive prices.</p>
                <p>However, he worries that prices could plunge if Japan's overall production goes unchecked under the
                    new policy, set to be implemented from the 2027 crop year.</p>
                <p>“I do feel conflicted,” Hosaka said about the doubling of retail rice prices to above ￥4,000
                    (US$27.80) for a 5kg bag this year in what has turned into a national crisis.</p>
                <p>“It's important that rice prices settle at levels acceptable to both producers and consumers,” he
                    said.</p>
                <p>Hosaka hopes prices would stabilize at about ￥3,000 to ￥3,500 — a level that Japanese Prime Minister
                    Shigeru Ishiba also hopes would be palatable for voters.</p>
                <p>Supermarket prices fell for a fifth straight week, to ￥3,801 in the seven days to June 22, but were
                    still 70 percent higher than the same period last year.</p>
                <p>For Japanese, rice is more than just a staple food. Cultivated in the country for more than 2,000
                    years, rice is considered sacred in the indigenous Shinto religion and is deeply ingrained in local
                    tradition and culture. The Japanese are famously proud of their short-grain Japonica variety,
                    protecting the market with trade barriers.</p>
                <p>So when rice turned into a luxury item this year, consumers fumed and policymakers — facing imminent
                    elections — worried. With an eye on voters ahead of an upper house election on July 20, the
                    government has been releasing emergency rice from its stockpile to sell for about ￥2,000 per 5kg.
                </p>
                <p>Farmers — also traditionally an important voting bloc for Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party — were
                    told it was a dire but necessary move to protect Japan's food security and prevent consumers from
                    switching permanently away from homegrown rice.</p>
                <p>However, for most of the past 50 years, Japan has poured its energy into doing the opposite:
                    providing subsidies to farmers to grow crops other than staple rice so as to prevent oversupply and
                    a fall in prices.</p>
                <p>That system backfired last year when the farm ministry misread supply from the heat-damaged 2023
                    harvest, resulting in a severe shortage in August that year. The ensuing surge in prices made Japan
                    an anomaly against a fall in global prices, and exposed the risks of its approach.</p>
                <p>The new policy, if successful, would prevent a recurrence by allocating 350,000 tonnes of rice for
                    export in 2030 — an eight-fold jump from 45,000 tonnes last year — that could be redirected to the
                    domestic market in the event of a shortage, the government says.</p>
                <p>Some agricultural experts say the policy is unrealistic. The idea of selling expensive Japanese rice
                    abroad is counterintuitive, especially when even Japan is importing record amounts of the grain
                    despite the ￥341 per kilogram levy that had previously priced foreign products out of the market.
                </p>
                <p>Japanese have also acquired a taste for US Calrose rice, while imports from Taiwan, Thailand and
                    Vietnam have also been popular with businesses and cost-conscious consumers.</p>
                <p>“Expensive rice might sell to niche markets, but getting that up to 350,000 tonnes would require
                    price competitiveness, and there's a long way for that,” said Kazunuki Ohizumi, professor emeritus
                    at Miyagi University and an expert on agricultural management.</p>
                <p>The government aims to provide some form of support but also expects farmers to make their own
                    efforts to consolidate, and make use of artificial intelligence and other technologies to lower
                    production costs.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Hosaka said, prices of fertilizers, pesticides and fuel have shot up, sending production
                    costs through the roof.</p>
                <p>“It's tough,” he said. “The government has released quite a bit of stockpiled rice, so I'm very
                    worried about prices falling even further.”</p>
