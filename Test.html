                <p class="subTitle">BALANCING ACT: While cellphones can help accelerate learning, schools must find a
                    balance to avoid
                    the
                    harmful effects of social media and addiction, the ministry said
                </p>
                <p style="color: gray;">By Hollie Younger / Staff writer, with CNA</p>
                <p>The Ministry of Education (MOE) yesterday announced new draft guidelines for cellphone use in schools
                    below college level, with stricter regulations for lower grades and flexibility for schools or
                    classes
                    to set their own rules.
                </p>
                <p>A "centralized management" approach would be adopted for elementary and junior-high schools under the
                    Guidelines
                    for Management of Mobile Device Use in School Campuses Below Senior High Level
                    (高級中等以下學校學生攜帶行動載具到校管理原則).
                </p>
                <p>Schools or individual classes would manage rules, but with details subject to approval by school
                    boards.
                </p>

                <p>As students are minors, parents and guardians would still bear legal responsibility for their
                    behavior
                    and safety, the guidelines say, adding that students would need permission from a legal guardian to
                    bring a mobile phone or similar device on campus.</p>
                <p>High schools would have more flexibility, allowing students, parents and teachers to jointly decide
                    on
                    management
                    methods, including when phones can be used on campus.</p>
                <p>High-school students have “self-management abilities” and may bring devices on campus in accordance
                    with
                    school
                    regulations, although schools are encouraged to inform parents of the rules, the ministry said.</p>
                <p>The student group EdYouth said in a statement that device usage should only be controlled during
                    class
                    time to
                    avoid overregulation.</p>
                <p>The ministry said that devices must be turned off or switched to airplane mode and stored away during
                    class
                    hours, except when used for educational purposes or emergency situations.</p>
                <p>Although technology can be used to accelerate learning, there must be a balance to avoid overreliance
                    on
                    personal
                    devices, the harmful effects of social media and addiction, it added.</p>
                <p>In other education news, MOE officials said they would consider shifting three days around on the
                    academic
                    calendar next year, after receiving feedback from parents.</p>
                <p>Parents' groups have said that a new semester calendar for elementary schools up to high schools
                    showed
                    that the
                    winter break would be between Jan. 21 and Feb. 10 next year, with school beginning on Feb. 11.</p>
                <p>However, three days later, the students would be off for the weekend, followed by Lunar New Year's
                    Eve on
                    Monday,
                    Feb. 16, and then the Lunar New Year holiday until Feb. 19.</p>
                <p>Parents said they wanted to eliminate the three intervening days, Feb. 11 to 13, to have consecutive
                    days
                    off,
                    making it easier to plan holiday trips.</p>
                <p>Ministry officials said they would collect feedback to make the adjustment, with one option being to
                    shift the
                    three intervening days, to hold classes on Jan. 21 to 23, at the start of winter break.</p>
                <p>The summer break for students would be 60 days, from July 1 to Aug. 28, it said.</p>
