            </p>
            <p>By Hollie Younger / Staff writer, with CNA</p>
            <p>The <span class="tooltip">Ministry<span class="tooltiptext">n. ministry (政府的)部門</span></span> of <span
                    class="tooltip">Education<span class="tooltiptext">n. education 教育</span></span><span
                    class="tooltip"> (MOE)<span class="tooltiptext">The Ministry of Education (MOE) 教育部</span></span>
                yesterday announced new <span class="tooltip">draft<span class="tooltiptext">n. 草案；草稿</span></span>
                guidelines for cellphone use in schools
                below
                college level, with stricter regulations for lower grades and flexibility for schools or classes to set
                their
                own rules.</p>
            <p>A “centralized management” approach would be adopted for elementary and junior-high schools under the
                Guidelines
                for Management of Mobile Device Use in School Campuses Below Senior High Level (高級中等以下學校學生攜帶行動載具到校管理原則).
            </p>
            <p>Schools or individual classes would manage rules, but with details subject to approval by school boards.
            </p>
            <p>A high-school student looks at a cellphone in front of the entrance of a high school in New Taipei City
                in an
                undated photograph.</p>

            <p>As students are minors, parents and guardians would still bear legal responsibility for their behavior
                and
                safety, the guidelines say, adding that students would need permission from a legal guardian to bring a
                mobile
                phone or similar device on campus.</p>
            <p>High schools would have more flexibility, allowing students, parents and teachers to jointly decide on
                management
                methods, including when phones can be used on campus.</p>
            <p>High-school students have “self-management abilities” and may bring devices on campus in accordance with
                school
                regulations, although schools are encouraged to inform parents of the rules, the ministry said.</p>
            <p>The student group EdYouth said in a statement that device usage should only be controlled during class
                time to
                avoid overregulation.</p>
            <p>The ministry said that devices must be turned off or switched to airplane mode and stored away during
                class
                hours, except when used for educational purposes or emergency situations.</p>
            <p>Although technology can be used to accelerate learning, there must be a balance to avoid overreliance on
                personal
                devices, the harmful effects of social media and addiction, it added.</p>
            <p>In other education news, MOE officials said they would consider shifting three days around on the
                academic
                calender next year, after receiving feedback from parents.</p>
            <p>Parents’ groups have said that a new semester calendar for elementary schools up to high schools showed
                that the
                winter break would be between Jan. 21 and Feb. 10 next year, with school beginning on Feb. 11.</p>
            <p>However, three days later, the students would be off for the weekend, followed by Lunar New Year’s Eve on
                Monday,
                Feb. 16, and then the Lunar New Year holiday until Feb. 19.</p>
            <p>Parents said they wanted to eliminate the three intervening days, Feb. 11 to 13, to have consecutive days
                off,
                making it easier to plan holiday trips.</p>
            <p>Ministry officials said they would collect feedback to make the adjustment, with one option being to
                shift the
                three intervening days, to hold classes on Jan. 21 to 23, at the start of winter break.</p>
            <p>The summer break for students would be 60 days, from July 1 to Aug. 28, it said.</p>
